# MachineLearning_MiniProject_EcommerceDecision_Python

Project Overview:
  1. This project used sklearn library to build a linear regression model to analyze an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they        also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions.
  2. This project is trying to help the company to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.
